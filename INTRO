GETTING STARTED
===============

Now you can start a server with the following command:

    $ sudo ./build/bin/webrocket-server

...and configure it afterwords:

    $ ./build/bin/webrocket-admin add_vhost /hello
    $ ./build/bin/webrocket-admin add_channel /hello world

To get started with WebRocket you can include the following code in your HTML file as a base:

    <script src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/webrocket.js"></script>
    <script>
        ws = new WebRocket("/test");
        ws.subscribe("test", function(channel) {
            // ...
        });
    </script>
