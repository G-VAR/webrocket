Installation
============

To install WebRocket you need the following tools and dependecies:

Latest Go compiler (supported tip version)
------------------------------------------
WebRocket is written in the Go programming language. Obviously you need to
have it installed on your machine in order to compile WebRocket. If you already
installed it, make sure that your version is supported by WebRocket.

IMPORTANT: WebRocket has to be built against the tip version (head version)!

To get and build a Go version working with current WebRocket implementation,
follow this instructions:

	$ hg clone https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go
	$ cd go/src
	$ ./all.bash

When the build succeeds you need to add few environment variables to your
'~/.bashrc' (or other shell configuration file):

	export PATH=/path/to/go:$PATH
	export GOPATH=/path/to/my-go-code
	
If you have any other doubts or problems please follow the instructions
in Go's documentation.
    
Building WebRocket
------------------
Once you have the Go compiler and all dependencies installed, we can move
to building our WebRocket installation. Building WebRocket is very easy and
shouldn't cause too many problems. After you clone the repository, just use
the standard 'make' targets to build and install:

	$ git clone git://github.com/webrocket/webrocket.git
	$ cd webrocket
	$ make && make install

Documentation and Manual pages
------------------------------
In order to generate manual pages or other documentation from sources
you need to have 'asciidoc' installed.

TIP: If you're an OSX user, in order to make the 'asciidoc' work
	properly you have to register the installed docbook.

	$ brew install docbook asciidoc
	$ sudo docbook-register

On any other Linux/Unix distribution it's enough to just install deps
with your favorite package manager:

.Debian
	$ apt-get install docbook asciidoc

.Arch Linux
	$ pacman -S asciidoc

.Fedora
	$ yum install asciidoc

Now you shall be able to use the following make targets:

	$ make man
	
...which generates man pages and its html versions in the 'docs/'
directory.
