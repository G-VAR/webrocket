Installation
============

Basic installation
------------------
WebRocket is written in Go language. If you don't have Go compiler
installed yet, follow this installation guide: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

IMPORTANT: So far, WebRocket is using bunch of unreleased features
and want to catch up with the Go's development, that's why you
should remember to clone *the head version* or the latest *weakly release*:

To get head version of the compiler use following command:

    hg clone https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go

Once you have the Go compiler installed, we can move to building our
WebRocket installation. Building WebRocket is very easy and shouldn't
cause too much problems. After you will clone the repository, just
use standard `make` targets to build and install:

    git clone git://github.com/nu7hatch/webrocket.git
    cd webrocket
    make install

Development environment
-----------------------
To start working on WebRocket development you have to install some
additional dependencies:

'asciidoc'::
		documentation and man pages generator

Make sure you read contributors guide before you submit patches.
You can find it in the 'CONTRIBUTE' file.
