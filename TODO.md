# TODO list

* clustering support
* change `ok` responses to event specific (eg. `authenticated`, `subscribed`, `broadcasted`)
* change `publish` to `broadcast`
* add direct message action (but first investigate if really needed)
* change confusing `read-only` and `read-write` access types to `admin` and `regular`
* add admin-protected channels (read-only for regular clients, read-write for admins)
